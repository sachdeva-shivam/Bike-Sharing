# Bike-Sharing

We are working for bike-sharing company in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
. This is a case study for Upgrad AI/ML program students
. Given a data set we are trying to provide insights and model to Bike sharing company as when count of people is hogh and depends on which variables


## Technologies Used
. Python 3.5
. Anaconda 3


## Conclusions
- Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.535253’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.535253 units.
- Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.294276’ indicated that, w.r.t Weathersit1, a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.294276 units.
- Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.235262’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.235262 units.
